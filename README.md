### Dynamic Web - Team of the Week

This project, initially created for educational purposes in JavaScript, now transitions into a potentially monetized endeavor. It offers a self-coded template dedicated to showcasing the standout footballers of the Belgian Jupiler Pro League. 

#### Overview
The primary function of this web page is to enable users to assemble their own "Team of the Week" by selecting eleven top-performing players from the league. The selection process involves manually adding players to a predefined class within the JavaScript code. These players are represented by links directing to their respective photos on the official Jupiler Pro League website. However, it's essential to note that these photos may no longer be available or accessible. As a result, users may need to update the URLs to ensure proper display of player images.

#### Future Development
This project is intended to serve as a foundation for further development, with plans to enhance automation and streamline processes. Future iterations may involve implementing features to automate player selection, update player information dynamically, and improve user experience. 

#### Licensing and Usage
While this project was initially created for educational purposes and offered freely, it has now transitioned into a potentially monetizable asset. Individuals or organizations interested in utilizing or acquiring this project for commercial purposes are required to obtain proper licensing or permissions.
